// PART A

// How do we assign a value to a variable?
// let, const, var followed by the name of the variable and equal it to the value

// How do we change the value of a variable?
// just name of the variable and make it equal to whatever the new value is going to be

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// ex. let newVar = oldVar;

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
// declare is when you declare the variable, so assign name, not necessary to assgin it something
// assign is when you assign a specific value to the variable
// define is when you decalare and at the same time define what its going to hold


// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
//pseduocoding is when you type out the code in plain english to understand what needs to coded

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?

// most of the time you need to spend pseudocoding and understanding the logic behind the problem
// once you figured out the logic and the pseudocode then you need to start working on the code

// PART B

var firstVariable = "Hello World";
firstVariable = 12;
var secondVariable = firstVariable;
secondVariable = "Bye World";
console.log(firstVariable); // value of the first variable

var yourName = "Hrak T";
var newStr = "Hello my name is " + yourName;
console.log(newStr);
